# Perfect Pet Finder

## Overview
**Perfect Pet Finder** is a modern React application designed to help users discover adoptable pets through a clean, accessible interface. The project began as a fully custom integration with the Petfinder public API and was later **refactored in response to real‑world API deprecation**, demonstrating adaptability, architectural decision‑making, and third‑party integration skills.

When Petfinder sunset their public API and transitioned to a Web Component–based widget, the application was re‑engineered to integrate the new data source while preserving application structure, routing, and user experience.

This project reflects how production applications evolve when external dependencies change.

---

## Key Features
- Responsive, multi‑page React application built with **Vite**
- Integration of a third‑party **Web Component (`<pet-scroller>`)** within a React environment
- Environment‑based configuration for external services
- Modular component architecture following best practices
- Graceful refactor from deprecated REST API to widget‑based solution
- Clean UI optimized for accessibility and usability

---

## Technical Highlights

### Real‑World API Migration
- Initially implemented custom data fetching, filtering, pagination, and card rendering using the Petfinder API
- Refactored application after API deprecation without breaking the overall app
- Replaced API‑dependent logic with a Web Component while maintaining layout, routing, and state boundaries

### Web Components + React
- Safely loads third‑party scripts at the application entry point
- Renders custom HTML elements within React components
- Passes serialized configuration via environment variables
- Maintains separation between third‑party UI and internal application logic

### Frontend Architecture
- Component‑driven design
- Route‑based page structure
- Centralized environment configuration
- Removal of dead code and legacy logic after refactor

## Tech Stack
- **React**
- **Vite**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Web Components**
- **Environment Variables (.env)**

```

---

## Configuration
The Petfinder widget is configured using environment variables:

```env
VITE_PETFINDER_ORG_JSON=["YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE"]
VITE_PETFINDER_LIMIT=12
```

This approach keeps configuration flexible across development and production environments.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Designing applications that can adapt to external API changes
- Integrating Web Components into a React ecosystem
- Making architectural tradeoffs when full customization is no longer available
- Refactoring legacy features safely and incrementally
- Treating third‑party services as replaceable data sources

---

## Future Improvements
- Add a "Saved Pets" feature using local storage
- Extend user preferences outside the widget
- Enhance accessibility and performance auditing

---

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates more than UI development — it shows:
- Real‑world problem solving
- Adaptability to breaking third‑party changes
- Frontend architectural thinking
- Production‑minded refactoring

**Perfect Pet Finder** reflects the type of challenges engineers face in real applications, where requirements evolve and external systems change.
